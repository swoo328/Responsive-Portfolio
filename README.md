# Summary 
I created a responsive-portfolio using components of bootstrap
for my project. In this project, I created three files index.html, 
portfolio.html, and a contact.html.In the index.html, I created an 
about me page containing information about myself, a bridge background 
and a photo of myself. The portfolio.html has a lot of pictures base on 
a fantasy theme that are going to be replaced for future projects. Lastly, 
the contact.html contains a contact form page. The components I use from 
bootstraps is the navbar and my submit button for my contact form page.
